    "description": "Yachiru is a hasshakusama youkai living in the human world. Because the prevailing public image of hasshakusama is that they're lewd, her powers have weakened and her height has shrunk from its original 8 shaku (240 cm) to about 190 cm. She strives to correct that impression, but each day is another failure. However, while at the cinema to study horror films, she meets Seiichirou, a young man who is a huge fan of hasshakusama. That's when Yachiru realizes that whenever Seiichirou praises her, her height returns to its original size...!!!\n___\n**Additional Links:**\n- **Alt Official Raws:**\n  - [MagaPoke](https://pocket.shonenmagazine.com/title/02927/episode/420064)\n  - [niconico Manga](https://manga.nicovideo.jp/comic/73100)\n  - [YanMaga Web](https://yanmaga.jp/comics/%E3%82%84%E3%81%A1%E3%82%8B%E3%81%95%E3%82%93%E3%81%AF%E3%81%BB%E3%82%81%E3%82%8B%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AE%E3%81%B3%E3%82%8B)\n- [Official X](https://x.com/yachirusanha)",

The comic is 'live' with the NA server of Fate/Grand Order, with new characters appearing in the comic around the time they appear in the game and comics often referencing recent events in the game.\n\nEnjoyment of this comic relies heavily upon the reader's familiarity with the game and its characters, so the author recommends playing Fate/Grand Order before reading this comic.\n\n---\n\nThis comic is being uploaded to MangaDex by reader request and with the approval of MangaDex staff.

However, he was chosen as a candidate for reincarnation to another world, but the woman who guided him to his reincarnation told him that she would not give him any cheats. Instead of cheats, he was offered three months of training at an otherworldly reincarnation training facility. The training facility was supposed to make it relatively easy to acquire skills, but what would he accomplish in three short months? He was given an Appraisal and an Item Box as bonus skills, but he was thrown into the training facility before he could even begin to set up his prowess.\n\nHe spent three months in the training facility, desperately training to survive his new life. But after 3 months, after 1 year, after 10 years, he was not reincarnated. He was worried he might have gone to the infinite hell of the game world since he died from playing too much video games, but he still trained desperately. In fact, he never thought that the reincarnation process was not completed due to a mistake made by the female guide. After all, when 15 years of training had passed, the information about reincarnation came unexpectedly. The man who had already become a cheat bastard to the point of killing an ancient dragon was trying his best to enjoy the other world in a normal way.",

    "description": "Our hero, Mo Fan, inherits a magical necklace—the next day, he wakes up to find that the world has changed. His high school now teaches magic, and students are encouraged to try and become accomplished magicians. A world that ran on science now runs on magic. However, some things are still the same. He still has a teacher who sees him as a hopeless student, classmates who look the same, a father who struggles to make ends meet, and a not-by-blood little sister who can't walk on her own.\nHowever, Mo Fan discovers that the vast majority of magicians can only harness one element of magic. As luck would have it, however, he is an exception—a versatile mage!\n\n(Source: WebNovel)\n\n\n---",

You'll be okay.\"\n\nEstio was born as the youngest son of a farmer, but everyone hated him. He was a child who could read the hearts of people and animals. And…\n\n\"A cursed child.\"\n\nHe finally turned 19, and it was now time for his coming-of-age ceremony. Now starts Estio's journey to find happiness.\n\n---\nEstio is just an ordinary farmer's son, but with an extraordinary ability-he can read the thoughts and memories of humans and animals. For this, he is shunned by the people in his village, finding happiness only in his animal friends. After years of silently enduring the villagers' hostility, Estio runs away the night he turns 19. His journey brings unexpected friendships and encounters, but will such bonds be able to show him there is more to him and his ability than meets the eye?\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EC%97%90%EC%8A%A4%ED%8B%B0%EC%98%A4/2761), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=58509736)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/estio/info)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/96041)",

At that time, Bridget meets the Duke's son Yuri, who is feared by those around him because of his overwhelming ability and cold personality.\n\nTwo people who hate each other and repel each other. However, the encounter gradually changes their destinies. This is the story of a villainess who is despised for being incompetent and a villain who is shunned for being a genius who eventually fall in love.\n\n---\nDespite her noble status, Brigitte contracts with the weakest type of spirit—and on that very same day, the prince publicly breaks off their engagement. No one shows much sympathy towards the once haughty young lady—except for the duke's son, Yuri, who attends the same magic academy. Yuri is feared for his incredible abilities and icy personality, but with him on her side, her fortunes might have changed…\n\n---\n**Original Web Novel:** [Kakuyomu](https://kakuyomu.jp/works/16816700426830814673), [Syosetu](https://ncode.syosetu.com/n9923hb/)",

Shikimura Masami is majorly into masochism, and has recruited Shinya into her play sessions.

For all Shinya knows, it could be true, but in practice it just means that he has to let her drink his blood. How will Shinya deal with all these good-for-nothing girls that complicate his life?",

Waking up in the infirmary without any signs of a snake bite, he is told by the school to take the rest of the day off.

    "description": "In an RPG-like fantasy world consumed by warring nations and racial discrimination, the human kingdom summons five high school students from 21st-century Japan for assistance in their conflict with the demonkin. Now those students, with their experience of MMORPGs at their disposal, will hone their skills to protect the human kingdom of Edea.  \n  \nHowever, this isn't their story.  \n  \nOut of the five students, four of them were given the title of Hero and the fifth one the title of Innocent Bystander. He had been summoned by accident since he sat near the other four students. His name is Hiiro Okamura, an aloof bookworm with traveling and reading as his raison d'etre. Hiiro sees no reason to help the human kingdom in their offensive war with the demonkin, seeing that he isn't a Hero and that he has no real obligation to help them, and decides to leave the kingdom to go on his own adventure.  \n  \nSoon, Hiiro finds out that he has the very unique skill of Word Magic: magic that can materialize the definition of a word. As he travels more and more, he finds many uses for his Word Magic and many opportunities to find books, level up, and gain some of his own companions. Even with the outbreak of war on the horizon, Hiiro stays true to his desire to travel the new world he's in.",

He can only conjure a cupful at a time, but it's enough to eke out a comfortable existence — or so he thought.\n\nThe powers that be cast him into the wild outlands with nothing more than a humble shack, a single knife, some food... and abilities that are yet beyond his comprehension. The area is overrun by monsters and there's nary another human in sight. Ryo must now figure out how to survive above all else, but he's ready to take bulls, boars, and a whole host of other monsters by the horns if it means seizing the life he wants for himself.\n\nEach new victory brings a new challenge, but what could a fateful encounter with a headless horseman, a dragon, and a castaway swordsman have in common? They're the first steps on a grand journey that will take Ryo beyond the borders of all he knows to become the greatest water magician the world has ever seen — one adventure at a time.",
